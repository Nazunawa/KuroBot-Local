# KuroBot
A discord bot for personal use. For a replit version, go to the [main page](https://github.com/DavedZrod/KuroBot)
## THIS PROJECT IS IN PROGRESS
This will not be fully kept up to date with the replit equivalent.

This branch is only for those who want to host it out of replit (In replit, it uses a monitor ping as KeepAlive). If you want to use the KeepAlive method, simply copy part of the code that runs it (in server.js and the beginning and end of index.js)
## Current Features
- Replacing twitter links with vxwtwitter (can be configured)
    - Vx-ivy slash command (instead of deleting your message)
- Custom message replies

## Dependencies
- [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)
- [commandkit](https://commandkit.js.org/)
